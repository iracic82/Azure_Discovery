# How to Update Your README (Optional)

If you created your repository from the template BEFORE the fix, your README still has the old button. Here's how to fix it:

---

## Option 1: Just Ignore the Button (Easiest)

**You don't need the button!**

Just use the Actions tab directly:
1. Go to your repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Click **"Onboard Azure Account for Infoblox DNS"**
4. Click **"Run workflow"**

âœ… This works perfectly - no update needed!

---

## Option 2: Manually Update Your README

If you want to fix the button in your repository:

1. In YOUR repository, edit the README.md file

2. Find this section:
```markdown
## ðŸš€ **Deploy to Azure**
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Microsoft_Azure_Logo.svg" width="120"></td>
    <td>
      <a href="https://github.com/iracic82/Azure_Discovery/actions/workflows/azure-onboard.yml">
        <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Deploy%20to%20Azure-Click%20to%20Run-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=azure">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

3. Replace it with:
```markdown
## ðŸš€ **How to Run**

### To run this workflow:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab (in YOUR repository)
2. Click **"Onboard Azure Account for Infoblox DNS"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. Fill in the inputs and run

**Note**: Don't use external links - always use YOUR repository's Actions tab!
```

4. Commit the change

âœ… Now your README won't have the confusing button!

---

## Option 3: Re-create from Updated Template

If you haven't done any customization yet:

1. Delete your current repository (or just leave it)
2. Go to: https://github.com/iracic82/Azure_Discovery
3. Click "Use this template" again
4. Create a new repository
5. Set up the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret again

âœ… You'll get the updated README without the confusing button!

---

## Recommendation

**Just use Option 1** - Ignore the button and use the Actions tab directly.

The button was never necessary. It was just a convenience link that unfortunately pointed to the wrong place.

Going forward, all new customers who create from the template will get the fixed version automatically!
